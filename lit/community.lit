TODO: consolidate these into one section briefly listing each one and what it
should be used for

\section{
  \title{GitHub}{github}

  Concourse is completely open-source. All of the source code lives under the
  \link{Concourse organization}{https://github.com/concourse} on GitHub. Pull
  requests welcome! (Issues too, I guess.)

  For a bird's eye view of the entire project, and to see what's in flight and
  coming up on our backlog, check out our
  \link{project.concourse-ci.org}{https://project.concourse-ci.org}.
}

\section{
  \title{Discuss}{discuss}

  The \link{Concourse forums}{https://discuss.concourse-ci.org} are a great
  place for discussions that are a bit more open-ended than GitHub issues or
  pull requests.

  These forums are for supporting end users and operators, planning
  contributions and volunteering ideas, and announcing new things like resource
  types and whatever other cool things y'all want to show off.
}

\section{
  \title{Discord}{discord}

  We use \link{Discord}{https://discordapp.com} for real-time chat amongst
  contributors. Click \link{here}{https://discord.gg/MeRxXKW} for an invite.

  If you're looking to become a contributor, you should drop in to Discord and
  introduce yourself! We're happy to help you on your way.

  If you're looking for help, we'd really appreciate it if you used the forums
  instead - threading and persistent messages make the support burden of an
  open-source project much easier to bear.

\section{
  \title{Blog}{blog}

  We often write long-form articles and project updates on our Concourse
  publication, hosted on \link{Medium}{https://medium.com/concourse-ci}.
}

\section{
  \title{Stack Overflow}{stackoverflow}

  Concourse questions can all be found on StackOverflow under the
  \link{\code{concourse}
  tag}{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/concourse}.
