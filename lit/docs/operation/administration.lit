  \title{\code{fly workers}}{fly-workers}

  To list the currently registered workers, including additional metadata, run:

  \codeblock{bash}{{
  $ fly -t example workers
  }}

  This can be useful for monitoring the status of your workers, if you suspect
  that one keeps dropping out of the pool or getting tasked with too many
  containers, etc.
}

\section{
  \title{\code{fly prune-worker}}{fly-prune-worker}

  To remove a stalled, landing, landed, or retiring worker, run:

  \codeblock{bash}{{
  $ fly -t example prune-worker --worker worker-name
  }}

  This is for those cases where you know a worker is not coming back. Note that
  running workers cannot be pruned, since they'll just re-register themselves
  anyway.
}

\section{
  \title{\code{fly land-worker}}{fly-land-worker}

  To initiate landing of a worker and eventually (after draining) cause it to
  exit, run:

  \codeblock{bash}{{
  $ fly -t example land-worker --worker worker-name
  }}
}

\section{
  \title{\code{fly containers}}{fly-containers}

  To list the active containers across all your workers, run:

  \codeblock{bash}{{
  $ fly -t example containers
  }}

  This can be useful when discovering the containers available for
  \reference{fly-intercept}ing.
}

\section{
  \title{\code{fly volumes}}{fly-volumes}

  To list the active volumes across all your workers, run:

  \codeblock{bash}{{
  $ fly -t example volumes
  }}

  This can be useful to observe the caches warming across your cluster, and
  could be a good indicator of disk use.
