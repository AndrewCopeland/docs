\title{Upgrading Concourse}

\use-plugin{concourse-docs}

Concourse is upgraded by stopping the Concourse process, swapping out the
\code{concourse} binary with the new one, and re-starting it. This should be
done on each \reference{web-node} and \reference{worker-node}. Be careful to
check the release notes for anything marked 'breaking' - in particular, you'll
want to look for any flags that have changed.

Each \reference{web-node} will automatically run migrations on start and lock
via the database to ensure only one of them runs the migrations. We currently
do not guarantee zero-downtime upgrades, as migrations may make changes that
confuse the older \code{web} nodes. This should resolve as each node is
upgraded, and shouldn't result in any inconsistent state.

Typically, Concourse can be upgraded from any version to any other version,
though around 3.x and 4.x we made some changes to how migrations are run, and
as a result the following upgrade paths must be followed:

\table{
  \table-row{Current Version}{Upgrade Path}
}{
  \table-row{< \ghrelease{v3.6.0}}{\ghrelease{v3.6.0} -> \ghrelease{v4.0.0} -> latest}
}{
  \table-row{= \ghrelease{v3.6.0}}{\ghrelease{v4.0.0} -> latest}
}

We'll try to minimize this kind of thing in the future.
