\title{\code{on_abort} step hook}{on-abort-step-hook}

Any step can have \code{on_abort} tacked onto it, whose value is a second
step to execute only if the parent step is aborted, via clicking the X in the
web UI or by running \reference{fly-abort-build}.

\define-attribute{on_abort: step}{
  The step to execute when the parent step aborts. If the attached step
  succeeds, the entire step is still \code{aborted}.
}

\right-side{Examples}{
  \example{Cleanup on Abort}{
    The following will perform the \code{cleanup} task only if the build is
    aborted while the \code{unit} task was running:

    \codeblock{yaml}{{
    plan:
    - get: foo
    - task: unit
      file: foo/unit.yml
      on_abort:
        task: cleanup
        file: foo/cleanup.yml
    }}
  }
}
