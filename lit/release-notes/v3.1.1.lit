\release{2017-5-31}{3.1.1}{1.6.0}{
  \note{fix}{
    Fixed a race condition during volume creation for worker base resource
    types. This would result in resource actions failing with \code{failed to
    create volume}.

    Unfortunately, to propagate this fix you'll need to recreate your workers,
    as they're in a broken state.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Fixed the reporting of database query metrics.
