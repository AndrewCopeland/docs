  \note{feature}{
    The \reference{fly-volumes} command will now show task cache volumes as
    \code{task-cache} and show the name of the task the cache is for.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    The last release (\reference{v3.3.0}) broke resource configs with nested
    maps in them. This is now fixed.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Fixed an ATC crash that would occur when trying to list pipelines while the
    database is down. Along the way we also made the endpoint quicker.
