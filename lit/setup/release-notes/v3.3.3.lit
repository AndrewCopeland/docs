\release{2017-7-24}{3.3.3}{1.6.0}{
  \note{feature}{
    Added support for \code{params} in \reference{image_resource}. This probably
    should've always been there, but hey at least its there now!
  }
  \note{feature}{
    The \resource{s3} supports \code{unpack}, which unarchives a tar/zip file on the
    \code{get} command. This enables s3 to be a provider for
    \reference{image_resource} docker images. Thanks to a PR by \ghuser{krishicks}!
